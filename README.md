# Refactoring Source Code into Semantic HTML5 Tags

## Description

Older websites are not updated with HTML features. This means that often search engines such as Google will skip over these websites and viewers will find these websites difficult to read. One of the most important features of HTML5 is semantics which makes it more comprehensible and allows it to be more informative, adaptive and interpretive by the browser. Completing this project allows one to become familiar with updating older source code with semantic tags to make content more informative for machines.
